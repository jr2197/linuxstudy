attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which
may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based
authentication protocols.

Timestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 /
2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of
the actual system time.","Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP
timestamp replies (14).",,"The difference between the local and remote clocks is -2 seconds.

141118,,,None,Laptop,tcp,22,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided,Valid credentials were provided for an available authentication protocol.,"Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

  - This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set super cookies in curl that are then passed back to more
    origins than what is otherwise allowed or possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get
    sent to different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in
    curl's function that verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a
    cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though
    `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain. (CVE-2023-46218)

  - The vulnerability exists due to an error when handling HSTS long file names. When saving HSTS data to an

    (CVE-2023-48795)

  - A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by
    different supported crypto backends. The return values from these were not properly checked, which could
    cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as
    an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures,
    terminating the connection. (CVE-2023-6918)

  - The vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in OpenSSH client. If an invalid user or
    hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand
    directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h or similar expansion token,
    then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could potentially perform command
    injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied ssh_config(5) directive.

  - A flaw was found in OpenSC packages that allow a potential PIN bypass. When a token/card is authenticated
    by one process, it can perform cryptographic operations in other processes when an empty zero-length pin
    is passed. This issue poses a security risk, particularly for OS logon/screen unlock and for small,
    permanently connected tokens to computers. Additionally, the token can internally track login status. This
    flaw allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access, carry out malicious actions, or compromise the system
    without the user's awareness. (CVE-2023-40660)

  - Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages, particularly in the card
    enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards. To take advantage of
    these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB
    device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow compromise
    key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.
    (CVE-2023-40661)

  - An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in OpenSC packages within the MyEID driver when handling
    symmetric key encryption. Exploiting this flaw requires an attacker to have physical access to the

FEDORA-2023-9de52d46bd advisory.

  - Multiple NSS NIST curves were susceptible to a side-channel attack known as Minerva. This attack could
    potentially allow an attacker to recover the private key. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6135)

  - The WebGL `DrawElementsInstanced` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when used on systems
    with the Mesa VM driver. This issue could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution and sandbox
    escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6856)

  - When resolving a symlink, a race may occur where the buffer passed to `readlink` may actually be smaller
    than necessary. *This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operating systems (Android, Linux, MacOS).
    Windows is unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox <
    121. (CVE-2023-6857)

  - Firefox was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow in `nsTextFragment` due to insufficient OOM handling.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6858)

  - A use-after-free condition affected TLS socket creation when under memory pressure. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6859)

  - The `VideoBridge` allowed any content process to use textures produced by remote decoders. This could be
    abused to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6860)

  - The `nsWindow::PickerOpen(void)` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when running in headless
    mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6861)

  - The `ShutdownObserver()` was susceptible to potentially undefined behavior due to its reliance on a
    dynamic type that lacked a virtual destructor. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird
    < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6863)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6864)

  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused
    in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs
    which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

  - In some instances, the user-agent would allow push requests which lacked a valid VAPID even though the
    push manager subscription defined one. This could allow empty messages to be sent from unauthorized
    parties. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6868)

  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This
    could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)

  - Applications which spawn a Toast notification in a background thread may have obscured fullscreen
    notifications displayed by Firefox. *This issue only affects Android versions of Firefox and Firefox
    Focus.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6870)

  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new
    protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)

  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing
    habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6872)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6873)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and
    mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of
    ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit for
    each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to 255, but the
    X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular number of buttons, leading to a heap
    overflow if a bigger value was used. (CVE-2023-6816)

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the X.Org server. This issue can be triggered when a
    device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. This issue may lead to an
    application crash, local privilege escalation (if the server runs with extended privileges), or remote
    code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments. (CVE-2024-0229)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not call the XACE hook when creating the
    buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When the client issues another request to access that resource (as with a
    GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access that buffer, such as a GC, the
    XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.
    (CVE-2024-0408)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The cursor code in both Xephyr and Xwayland uses the wrong type of
    private at creation. It uses the cursor bits type with the cursor as private, and when initiating the
    cursor, that overwrites the XSELINUX context. (CVE-2024-0409)

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. In the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function, it is possible to exceed the
    allocated array length when certain new device IDs are added to the xXIHierarchyInfo struct. This can
    trigger a heap buffer overflow condition, which may lead to an application crash or remote code execution
    in SSH X11 forwarding environments. (CVE-2024-21885)

  - vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities used by multiple rust-vmm
    components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0, an issue in the
    `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for
    `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does
    not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths
    might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version
    0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any
    deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that header
    length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds
    memory access from Rust-safe code. (CVE-2023-50711)

    cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and
    inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1550)

  - Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker
    could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could
    inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1551)

  - Incorrect code generation could have led to unexpected numeric conversions and potential undefined
    behavior.*Note:* This issue only affects 32-bit ARM devices. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1552)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 122, Firefox ESR 115.7, and Thunderbird 115.7. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and
    Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1553)

  - The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the
    optional headers `fetch()` may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to
    poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled by the additional
    headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected
    response. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1554)

  - When opening a website using the `firefox://` protocol handler, SameSite cookies were not properly
    respected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1555)

  - The incorrect object was checked for NULL in the built-in profiler, potentially leading to invalid memory
    access and undefined behavior. *Note:* This issue only affects the application when the profiler is
    running. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1556)

  - The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the
    optional headers `fetch()` may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to
    poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled by the additional

FEDORA-2024-d16d94b00d advisory.

  - In btrfs_get_root_ref in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there can be an assertion
    failure and crash because a subvolume can be read out too soon after its root item is inserted upon
    subvolume creation. (CVE-2024-23850)

  - copy_params in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1 can attempt to allocate more than
    INT_MAX bytes, and crash, because of a missing param_kernel->data_size check. This is related to
    ctl_ioctl. (CVE-2024-23851)

  - Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.
    (CVE-2023-52437)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend
    solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
    are now tightly controlling when completion fires. (CVE-2024-26583)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak
    subject / changelog ] (CVE-2024-26603)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Revert kobject: Remove redundant
    checks for whether ktype is NULL This reverts commit 1b28cb81dab7c1eedc6034206f4e8d644046ad31. It is
    reported to cause problems, so revert it for now until the root cause can be found. (CVE-2024-26604)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call

    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

  - In btrfs_get_root_ref in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there can be an assertion
    failure and crash because a subvolume can be read out too soon after its root item is inserted upon

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,

141118,,,None,Desktop,tcp,22,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided,Valid credentials were provided for an available authentication protocol.,"Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

  - This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set super cookies in curl that are then passed back to more
    origins than what is otherwise allowed or possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get
    sent to different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in
    curl's function that verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a
    cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though
    `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain. (CVE-2023-46218)

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other

    hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a ProxyCommand, LocalCommand
    directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h or similar expansion token,
    then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could potentially perform command
    injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied ssh_config(5) directive.

  - A flaw was found in OpenSC packages that allow a potential PIN bypass. When a token/card is authenticated
    by one process, it can perform cryptographic operations in other processes when an empty zero-length pin
    is passed. This issue poses a security risk, particularly for OS logon/screen unlock and for small,
    permanently connected tokens to computers. Additionally, the token can internally track login status. This
    flaw allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access, carry out malicious actions, or compromise the system
    without the user's awareness. (CVE-2023-40660)

  - Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC packages, particularly in the card
    enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards. To take advantage of
    these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB
    device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow compromise
    key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.
    (CVE-2023-40661)

  - An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in OpenSC packages within the MyEID driver when handling
    symmetric key encryption. Exploiting this flaw requires an attacker to have physical access to the

    dynamic type that lacked a virtual destructor. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird
    < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6863)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6864)

  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused
    in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs
    which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

  - In some instances, the user-agent would allow push requests which lacked a valid VAPID even though the
    push manager subscription defined one. This could allow empty messages to be sent from unauthorized
    parties. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6868)

  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This
    could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)

  - Applications which spawn a Toast notification in a background thread may have obscured fullscreen
    notifications displayed by Firefox. *This issue only affects Android versions of Firefox and Firefox
    Focus.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6870)

  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new
    protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)

  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing
    habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6872)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This

FEDORA-2023-9de52d46bd advisory.

  - Multiple NSS NIST curves were susceptible to a side-channel attack known as Minerva. This attack could
    potentially allow an attacker to recover the private key. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6135)

  - The WebGL `DrawElementsInstanced` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when used on systems
    with the Mesa VM driver. This issue could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution and sandbox
    escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6856)

  - When resolving a symlink, a race may occur where the buffer passed to `readlink` may actually be smaller
    than necessary. *This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operating systems (Android, Linux, MacOS).
    Windows is unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox <
    121. (CVE-2023-6857)

  - Firefox was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow in `nsTextFragment` due to insufficient OOM handling.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6858)

  - A use-after-free condition affected TLS socket creation when under memory pressure. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6859)

  - The `VideoBridge` allowed any content process to use textures produced by remote decoders. This could be
    abused to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6860)

  - The `nsWindow::PickerOpen(void)` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when running in headless
    mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6861)

  - The `ShutdownObserver()` was susceptible to potentially undefined behavior due to its reliance on a
    dynamic type that lacked a virtual destructor. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird
    < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6863)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6864)

  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused
    in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs
    which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

  - In some instances, the user-agent would allow push requests which lacked a valid VAPID even though the
    push manager subscription defined one. This could allow empty messages to be sent from unauthorized
    parties. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6868)

  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This
    could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)

  - Applications which spawn a Toast notification in a background thread may have obscured fullscreen
    notifications displayed by Firefox. *This issue only affects Android versions of Firefox and Firefox
    Focus.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6870)

  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new
    protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)

  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing
    habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6872)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6873)

    than necessary. *This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operating systems (Android, Linux, MacOS).
    Windows is unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox <
    121. (CVE-2023-6857)

  - Firefox was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow in `nsTextFragment` due to insufficient OOM handling.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6858)

  - A use-after-free condition affected TLS socket creation when under memory pressure. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6859)

  - The `VideoBridge` allowed any content process to use textures produced by remote decoders. This could be
    abused to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6860)

  - The `nsWindow::PickerOpen(void)` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when running in headless
    mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6861)

  - The `ShutdownObserver()` was susceptible to potentially undefined behavior due to its reliance on a
    dynamic type that lacked a virtual destructor. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird
    < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6863)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6864)

  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused
    in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs
    which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

  - In some instances, the user-agent would allow push requests which lacked a valid VAPID even though the
    push manager subscription defined one. This could allow empty messages to be sent from unauthorized
    parties. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6868)

  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This
    could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)

  - Applications which spawn a Toast notification in a background thread may have obscured fullscreen
    notifications displayed by Firefox. *This issue only affects Android versions of Firefox and Firefox
    Focus.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6870)

  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new
    protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)

  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing
    habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6872)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6873)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and
    mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of
    ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and
    (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit for
    each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to 255, but the
    X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular number of buttons, leading to a heap
    overflow if a bigger value was used. (CVE-2023-6816)

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the X.Org server. This issue can be triggered when a
    device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. This issue may lead to an
    application crash, local privilege escalation (if the server runs with extended privileges), or remote
    code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments. (CVE-2024-0229)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not call the XACE hook when creating the
    buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When the client issues another request to access that resource (as with a
    GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access that buffer, such as a GC, the
    XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.
    (CVE-2024-0408)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The cursor code in both Xephyr and Xwayland uses the wrong type of
    private at creation. It uses the cursor bits type with the cursor as private, and when initiating the
    cursor, that overwrites the XSELINUX context. (CVE-2024-0409)

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. In the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function, it is possible to exceed the
    allocated array length when certain new device IDs are added to the xXIHierarchyInfo struct. This can
    trigger a heap buffer overflow condition, which may lead to an application crash or remote code execution

  - vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities used by multiple rust-vmm
    components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0, an issue in the
    `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for
    `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does
    not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths
    might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version
    0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any
    deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that header
    length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds
    memory access from Rust-safe code. (CVE-2023-50711)

  - The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the
    optional headers `fetch()` may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to
    poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled by the additional
    headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected
    response. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1554)

    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend
    solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
    are now tightly controlling when completion fires. (CVE-2024-26583)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Revert kobject: Remove redundant
    checks for whether ktype is NULL This reverts commit 1b28cb81dab7c1eedc6034206f4e8d644046ad31. It is
    reported to cause problems, so revert it for now until the root cause can be found. (CVE-2024-26604)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

  - In btrfs_get_root_ref in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there can be an assertion
    failure and crash because a subvolume can be read out too soon after its root item is inserted upon

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the

FEDORA-2024-d16d94b00d advisory.

  - In btrfs_get_root_ref in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there can be an assertion
    failure and crash because a subvolume can be read out too soon after its root item is inserted upon
    subvolume creation. (CVE-2024-23850)

  - copy_params in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1 can attempt to allocate more than
    INT_MAX bytes, and crash, because of a missing param_kernel->data_size check. This is related to
    ctl_ioctl. (CVE-2024-23851)

  - Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.
    (CVE-2023-52437)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend
    solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
    are now tightly controlling when completion fires. (CVE-2024-26583)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak
    subject / changelog ] (CVE-2024-26603)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Revert kobject: Remove redundant
    checks for whether ktype is NULL This reverts commit 1b28cb81dab7c1eedc6034206f4e8d644046ad31. It is
    reported to cause problems, so revert it for now until the root cause can be found. (CVE-2024-26604)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

FEDORA-2024-113454b56b advisory.

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 123. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 124. (CVE-2024-2615)

  - NSS was susceptible to a timing side-channel attack when performing RSA decryption. This attack could
    potentially allow an attacker to recover the private data. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124,
    Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2023-5388)

  - An attacker could have leveraged the Windows Error Reporter to run arbitrary code on the system escaping
    the sandbox. *Note:* This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are
    unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9.
    (CVE-2024-2605)

  - Passing invalid data could have led to invalid wasm values being created, such as arbitrary integers
    turning into pointer values. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124. (CVE-2024-2606)

  - Return registers were overwritten which could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code. *Note:*
    This issue only affected Armv7-A systems. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2607)

  - `AppendEncodedAttributeValue(), ExtraSpaceNeededForAttrEncoding()` and `AppendEncodedCharacters()` could
    have experienced integer overflows, causing underallocation of an output buffer leading to an out of
    bounds write. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9.
    (CVE-2024-2608)

  - The permission prompt input delay could have expired while the window is not in focus, which made the
    prompt vulnerable to clickjacking by malicious websites. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124.
    (CVE-2024-2609)

  - Using a markup injection an attacker could have stolen nonce values. This could have been used to bypass
    strict content security policies. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and
    Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2610)

  - A missing delay on when pointer lock was used could have allowed a malicious page to trick a user into
    granting permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird <
    115.9. (CVE-2024-2611)

  - If an attacker could find a way to trigger a particular code path in `SafeRefPtr`, it could have triggered
    a crash or potentially be leveraged to achieve code execution. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124,
    Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2612)

  - Data was not properly sanitized when decoding a QUIC ACK frame; this could have led to unrestricted memory
    consumption and a crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124. (CVE-2024-2613)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 123, Firefox ESR 115.8, and Thunderbird 115.8. Some of these bugs

141118,,,None,Server,tcp,22,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided,Valid credentials were provided for an available authentication protocol.,"Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

  - The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation
    can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023. (CVE-2023-44487)

  - When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory
    resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A
    client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory
    footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run
    out of memory before that. This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid
    Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During normal HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is
    very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out. Users are

  - This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set super cookies in curl that are then passed back to more
    origins than what is otherwise allowed or possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would get
    sent to different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in
    curl's function that verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a
    cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though
    `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain. (CVE-2023-46218)

  - The vulnerability exists due to an error when handling HSTS long file names. When saving HSTS data to an
    excessively long file name, curl can end up removing all contents from the file, making subsequent
    requests using that file unaware of the HSTS status they should otherwise use. As a result, a remote
    attacker can perform MitM attack.   (CVE-2023-46219)

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and
    mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of
    ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and
    (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API

FEDORA-2023-9de52d46bd advisory.

  - Multiple NSS NIST curves were susceptible to a side-channel attack known as Minerva. This attack could
    potentially allow an attacker to recover the private key. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6135)

  - The WebGL `DrawElementsInstanced` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when used on systems
    with the Mesa VM driver. This issue could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution and sandbox
    escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6856)

  - When resolving a symlink, a race may occur where the buffer passed to `readlink` may actually be smaller
    than necessary. *This bug only affects Firefox on Unix-based operating systems (Android, Linux, MacOS).
    Windows is unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox <
    121. (CVE-2023-6857)

  - Firefox was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow in `nsTextFragment` due to insufficient OOM handling.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6858)

  - A use-after-free condition affected TLS socket creation when under memory pressure. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6859)

  - The `VideoBridge` allowed any content process to use textures produced by remote decoders. This could be
    abused to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6860)

  - The `nsWindow::PickerOpen(void)` method was susceptible to a heap buffer overflow when running in headless
    mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6861)

  - The `ShutdownObserver()` was susceptible to potentially undefined behavior due to its reliance on a
    dynamic type that lacked a virtual destructor. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird
    < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6863)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6864)

  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused
    in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs
    which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

  - In some instances, the user-agent would allow push requests which lacked a valid VAPID even though the
    push manager subscription defined one. This could allow empty messages to be sent from unauthorized
    parties. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6868)

  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This
    could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)

  - Applications which spawn a Toast notification in a background thread may have obscured fullscreen
    notifications displayed by Firefox. *This issue only affects Android versions of Firefox and Firefox
    Focus.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6870)

  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new
    protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)

  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing
    habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6872)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6873)

    dynamic type that lacked a virtual destructor. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird
    < 115.6, and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6863)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6, Thunderbird < 115.6, and
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6864)

  - `EncryptingOutputStream` was susceptible to exposing uninitialized data. This issue could only be abused
    in order to write data to a local disk which may have implications for private browsing mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - TypedArrays can be fallible and lacked proper exception handling. This could lead to abuse in other APIs
    which expect TypedArrays to always succeed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6866)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

  - In some instances, the user-agent would allow push requests which lacked a valid VAPID even though the
    push manager subscription defined one. This could allow empty messages to be sent from unauthorized
    parties. *This bug only affects Firefox on Android.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.
    (CVE-2023-6868)

  - A `<dialog>` element could have been manipulated to paint content outside of a sandboxed iframe. This
    could allow untrusted content to display under the guise of trusted content. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6869)

  - Applications which spawn a Toast notification in a background thread may have obscured fullscreen
    notifications displayed by Firefox. *This issue only affects Android versions of Firefox and Firefox
    Focus.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6870)

  - Under certain conditions, Firefox did not display a warning when a user attempted to navigate to a new
    protocol handler. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6871)

  - Browser tab titles were being leaked by GNOME to system logs. This could potentially expose the browsing
    habits of users running in a private tab. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6872)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 120. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6873)

187201,CVE-2023-48795,6.4,Medium,Server,tcp,22,OpenSSH < 9.6 Multiple Vulnerabilities,The SSH server running on the remote host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.,"The version of OpenSSH installed on the remote host is prior to 9.6. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h

FEDORA-2024-3bb23c77f3 advisory.

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and
    mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of
    ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and
    (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the X.Org server. This issue can be triggered when a
    device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. This issue may lead to an
    application crash, local privilege escalation (if the server runs with extended privileges), or remote
    code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments. (CVE-2024-0229)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not call the XACE hook when creating the
    buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When the client issues another request to access that resource (as with a
    GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access that buffer, such as a GC, the
    XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The cursor code in both Xephyr and Xwayland uses the wrong type of

    cursor, that overwrites the XSELINUX context. (CVE-2024-0409)

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. In the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function, it is possible to exceed the

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit for
    each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to 255, but the
    X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular number of buttons, leading to a heap
    overflow if a bigger value was used. (CVE-2023-6816)

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the X.Org server. This issue can be triggered when a
    device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. This issue may lead to an
    application crash, local privilege escalation (if the server runs with extended privileges), or remote
    code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments. (CVE-2024-0229)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not call the XACE hook when creating the
    buffer, leaving it unlabeled. When the client issues another request to access that resource (as with a
    GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to access that buffer, such as a GC, the
    XSELINUX code will try to use an object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.
    (CVE-2024-0408)

  - A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The cursor code in both Xephyr and Xwayland uses the wrong type of
    private at creation. It uses the cursor bits type with the cursor as private, and when initiating the
    cursor, that overwrites the XSELINUX context. (CVE-2024-0409)

  - A flaw was found in X.Org server. In the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function, it is possible to exceed the
    allocated array length when certain new device IDs are added to the xXIHierarchyInfo struct. This can
    trigger a heap buffer overflow condition, which may lead to an application crash or remote code execution
    in SSH X11 forwarding environments. (CVE-2024-21885)

  - vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and utilities used by multiple rust-vmm
    components. Starting in version 0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0, an issue in the
    `FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate for
    `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The deserialization does
    not check that the length stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in the lengths
    might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe methods. The issue was corrected in version
    0.12.0 by inserting a check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal for any
    deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise. Moreover, the API was changed so that header
    length can only be modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot trigger out-of-bounds
    memory access from Rust-safe code. (CVE-2023-50711)

    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1548)

  - If a website set a large custom cursor, portions of the cursor could have overlapped with the permission
    dialog, potentially resulting in user confusion and unexpected granted permissions. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1549)

  - A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and `requestPointerLock` to
    cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and
    inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1550)

  - Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker
    could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could
    inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1551)

  - Incorrect code generation could have led to unexpected numeric conversions and potential undefined
    behavior.*Note:* This issue only affects 32-bit ARM devices. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1552)

    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and
    Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1553)

  - The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as the cache key did not include the
    optional headers `fetch()` may contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been able to
    poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()` response controlled by the additional
    headers. Upon navigation to the same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the expected
    response. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1554)

  - When opening a website using the `firefox://` protocol handler, SameSite cookies were not properly
    respected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1555)

  - The incorrect object was checked for NULL in the built-in profiler, potentially leading to invalid memory
    access and undefined behavior. *Note:* This issue only affects the application when the profiler is
    running. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123. (CVE-2024-1556)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend
    solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
    are now tightly controlling when completion fires. (CVE-2024-26583)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

    checks for whether ktype is NULL This reverts commit 1b28cb81dab7c1eedc6034206f4e8d644046ad31. It is
    reported to cause problems, so revert it for now until the root cause can be found. (CVE-2024-26604)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

  - In btrfs_get_root_ref in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there can be an assertion
    failure and crash because a subvolume can be read out too soon after its root item is inserted upon
    subvolume creation. (CVE-2024-23850)

  - copy_params in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 6.7.1 can attempt to allocate more than
    INT_MAX bytes, and crash, because of a missing param_kernel->data_size check. This is related to
    ctl_ioctl. (CVE-2024-23851)

  - Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.
    (CVE-2023-52437)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend
    solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
    are now tightly controlling when completion fires. (CVE-2024-26583)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between tx work
    scheduling and socket close Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit
    as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling the work before calling
    complete(). This seems more logical in the first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting
    thread will do. (CVE-2024-26585)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: fix use-after-free with
    partial reads and async decrypt tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb, so
    the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a use-after-free in process_rx_list when
    we try to read from the partially-read skb. (CVE-2024-26582)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto
    requests Since we're setting the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
    crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example,
    when the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
    cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog but still processed. In that case,
    the async callback will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can just
    ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new
    tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the
    error handling paths. The handling is identical. (CVE-2024-26584)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: tls: fix race between async notify and
    socket close The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the async crypto
    handler calls complete() so any code past that point risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the
    locking and extra flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way we can depend
    solely on the atomic ref counter for synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
    are now tightly controlling when completion fires. (CVE-2024-26583)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: i2c: i801: Fix block process call
    transactions According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block buffer index twice for block
    process call transactions: once before writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
    reading the incoming data from the buffer. The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the
    wrong portion of the block buffer to be read. (CVE-2024-26593)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for
    info to fault in xsave buffer Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was taken
    from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from user-space, so it is possible construct a
    sigreturn frame where: * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
    fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of the buffer
    required by xrstor is accessible. In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf + fx_sw->xstate_size is within the
    still mapped area, so it goes back and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
    fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: Revert kobject: Remove redundant
    checks for whether ktype is NULL This reverts commit 1b28cb81dab7c1eedc6034206f4e8d644046ad31. It is
    reported to cause problems, so revert it for now until the root cause can be found. (CVE-2024-26604)

  - In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: binder: signal epoll threads of self-
    work In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for consumption.
    Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make
    use of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is then crucial that epoll threads
    are signaled via wakeup when they queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands won't trigger a wakeup either as
    the thread has pending work. (CVE-2024-26606)

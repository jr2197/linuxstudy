attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which
may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based
authentication protocols.

2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of
the actual system time.","Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP

141118,,,None,Laptop,tcp,22,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided,Valid credentials were provided for an available authentication protocol.,"Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

  - CVE-2023-38545 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake in libcurl and
    curl.  When curl is given a hostname to pass along to a SOCKS5 proxy that is greater than 255 bytes in
    length, it will switch to local name resolution in order to resolve the address before passing it on to
    the SOCKS5 proxy. However, due to a bug introduced in 2020, this local name resolution could fail due to a
    slow SOCKS5 handshake, causing curl to pass on the hostname greater than 255 bytes in length into the
    target buffer, leading to a heap overflow.  The advisory for CVE-2023-38545 gives an example exploitation
    scenario of a malicious HTTPS server redirecting to a specially crafted URL. While it might seem that an
    attacker would need to influence the slowness of the SOCKS5 handshake, the advisory states that server
    latency is likely slow enough to trigger this bug. (CVE-2023-38545)

  - CVE-2023-38546 is a cookie injection vulnerability in the curl_easy_duphandle(), a function in libcurl
    that duplicates easy handles.  When duplicating an easy handle, if cookies are enabled, the duplicated
    easy handle will not duplicate the cookies themselves, but would instead set the filename to none.'
    Therefore, when the duplicated easy handle is subsequently used, if a source was not set for the cookies,
    libcurl would attempt to load them from the file named none' on the disk.  This vulnerability is rated
    low, as the various conditions required for exploitation are unlikely.  (CVE-2023-38546)

  - Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated
    data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV
    algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing adding
    or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently
    unaware of any such applications. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
    data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call
    EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input
    buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of
    performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As
    this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an
    application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue. (CVE-2023-2975)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too
    large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is
    over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
    parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has
    already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters
    obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those
    other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
    EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
    when using the '-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The
    OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-3446)

    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter
    value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if
    present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if
    q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an

    performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As

    application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue. (CVE-2023-2975)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too
    large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is
    over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
    parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has
    already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters
    obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those
    other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
    EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
    when using the '-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The
    OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-3446)

    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter
    value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if
    present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if
    q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an

  - urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect
    (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the
    authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue
    exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive). (CVE-2018-25091)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header
    special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been
    patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP
    request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method
    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle
    301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input length validation in `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read
    out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all
    users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the drive redirection channel -
    command line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`. (CVE-2022-41877)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.
    Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be
    triggered when the values `rect->left` and `rect->top` are exactly equal to `surface->width` and
    `surface->height`. eg. `rect->left` == `surface->width` && `rect->top` == `surface->height`. In practice
    this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-39352)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.

  - cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In

    but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated,
    thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an
    exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in

    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has

    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source

    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - This affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the
    `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most
    exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format
    user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process
    memory. (CVE-2020-28493)

  - Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar
    to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template,
    potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr` filter can be abused to inject

  - Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or
    parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
    generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(),
    DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may
    experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an
    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks
    (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable
    for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an
    excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls
    DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source
    could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(),
    EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
    application when using the -pubcheck option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.
    The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
    are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-5678)

  - Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might
    corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides
    vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is
    used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The
    POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the
    contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these
    vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer
    PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal
    application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
    depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker
    could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector
    registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some
    application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm
    is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated
    data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If
    this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.
    This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are
    currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider
    this a Low severity security issue. (CVE-2023-6129)

  - Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a
    potential Denial of Service attack Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from
    untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and
    may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL
    does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in
    OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs
    then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
    PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and
    PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function
    is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and
    3.0 are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-0727)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long
    delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a
    Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is
    done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more
    large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this
    computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA
    key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL
    pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the
    '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by
    this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. Found by OSS-Fuzz. Fix

    untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and
    may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL
    does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in
    OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs
    then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
    PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and
    PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function
    is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and
    3.0 are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-0727)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long
    delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a
    Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is
    done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more
    large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this
    computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA
    key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL
    pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the
    '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by
    this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. Found by OSS-Fuzz. Fix
    developed by Tomas Mraz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.13 (Affected since 3.0.0). (CVE-2023-6237)

  - The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity is overly high.
    It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive
    CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative
    servers and recursive resolvers. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through

    through 9.18.21-S1. (CVE-2023-4408)

  - A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when: -

referenced in the USN-6666-1 advisory.

  - libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function
    in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to
    256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like
    `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft
    payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due
    to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and
    subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a
    terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar
    to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache
    these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username.
    This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2024-24806)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6718-1 advisory.

  - When a protocol selection parameter option disables all protocols without adding any then the default set
    of protocols would remain in the allowed set due to an error in the logic for removing protocols. The
    below command would perform a request to curl.se with a plaintext protocol which has been explicitly
    disabled. curl --proto -all,-http http://curl.se The flaw is only present if the set of selected protocols
    disables the entire set of available protocols, in itself a command with no practical use and therefore
    unlikely to be encountered in real situations. The curl security team has thus assessed this to be low
    severity bug. (CVE-2024-2004)

  - When an application tells libcurl it wants to allow HTTP/2 server push, and the amount of received headers
    for the push surpasses the maximum allowed limit (1000), libcurl aborts the server push. When aborting,
    libcurl inadvertently does not free all the previously allocated headers and instead leaks the memory.
    Further, this error condition fails silently and is therefore not easily detected by an application.

    function calls the AllocateGlyph()             function to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X
    server.             AllocateGlyph() would return a new glyph with refcount=0 and             a re-used
    glyph would end up not changing the refcount at all.             The resulting glyph_new array would thus
    have multiple entries             pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs.
    ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, resulting in a             use-after-free when the same glyph
    pointer is then later used. (CVE-2024-31083)

141118,,,None,Desktop,tcp,22,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided,Valid credentials were provided for an available authentication protocol.,"Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

  - CVE-2023-38545 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake in libcurl and
    curl.  When curl is given a hostname to pass along to a SOCKS5 proxy that is greater than 255 bytes in
    length, it will switch to local name resolution in order to resolve the address before passing it on to
    the SOCKS5 proxy. However, due to a bug introduced in 2020, this local name resolution could fail due to a
    slow SOCKS5 handshake, causing curl to pass on the hostname greater than 255 bytes in length into the
    target buffer, leading to a heap overflow.  The advisory for CVE-2023-38545 gives an example exploitation
    scenario of a malicious HTTPS server redirecting to a specially crafted URL. While it might seem that an
    attacker would need to influence the slowness of the SOCKS5 handshake, the advisory states that server
    latency is likely slow enough to trigger this bug. (CVE-2023-38545)

  - CVE-2023-38546 is a cookie injection vulnerability in the curl_easy_duphandle(), a function in libcurl
    that duplicates easy handles.  When duplicating an easy handle, if cookies are enabled, the duplicated
    easy handle will not duplicate the cookies themselves, but would instead set the filename to none.'
    Therefore, when the duplicated easy handle is subsequently used, if a source was not set for the cookies,
    libcurl would attempt to load them from the file named none' on the disk.  This vulnerability is rated
    low, as the various conditions required for exploitation are unlikely.  (CVE-2023-38546)

  - Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated
    data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV
    algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing adding
    or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently
    unaware of any such applications. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
    data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call
    EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input

    performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too
    large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is
    over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
    parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has
    already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters
    obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those
    other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
    EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
    when using the '-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The
    OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-3446)

    value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if
    present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if
    q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an

  - urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect
    (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the
    authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue
    exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive). (CVE-2018-25091)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header
    special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been
    patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP
    request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method
    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle
    301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input length validation in `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read
    out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all
    users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the drive redirection channel -
    command line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`. (CVE-2022-41877)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.
    Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be
    triggered when the values `rect->left` and `rect->top` are exactly equal to `surface->width` and
    `surface->height`. eg. `rect->left` == `surface->width` && `rect->top` == `surface->height`. In practice
    this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-39352)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input length validation in `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read
    out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all
    users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the drive redirection channel -
    command line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`. (CVE-2022-41877)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.
    Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be
    triggered when the values `rect->left` and `rect->top` are exactly equal to `surface->width` and
    `surface->height`. eg. `rect->left` == `surface->width` && `rect->top` == `surface->height`. In practice
    this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-39352)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.
    In affected versions a missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound Read in the function
    `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no code to validate if the value
    `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles
    without proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead to a crash.

    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1886)

  - Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1897, CVE-2022-2000)

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - NULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4959. (CVE-2022-1725)

  - Uncontrolled Recursion in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4975. (CVE-2022-1771)

  - Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1886)

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other

187106,CVE-2023-48795,5.4,Medium,Desktop,tcp,0,Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS / 23.04 / 23.10 : libssh vulnerability (USN-6561-1),The remote Ubuntu host is missing a security update.,"The remote Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 22.04 LTS / 23.04 / 23.10 host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability
as referenced in the USN-6561-1 advisory.

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and
    mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of
    ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and
    (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

  - This affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the
    `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most

  - Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or
    parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
    generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(),
    DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may
    experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an
    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks
    (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable
    for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an
    excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls
    DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source
    could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(),
    EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
    application when using the -pubcheck option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.
    The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
    are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-5678)

  - Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might
    corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides
    vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is
    used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The
    POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the
    contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these
    vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer
    PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal
    application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
    depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker
    could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector
    registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some
    application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm
    is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated
    data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If
    this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.
    This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are
    currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider
    this a Low severity security issue. (CVE-2023-6129)

  - Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a
    potential Denial of Service attack Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from
    untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and
    may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL
    does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in
    OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs
    then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
    PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and
    PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function
    is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and
    3.0 are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-0727)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long
    delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a
    Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is
    done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more
    large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this
    computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA
    key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL
    pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the
    '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by
    this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. Found by OSS-Fuzz. Fix
    developed by Tomas Mraz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.13 (Affected since 3.0.0). (CVE-2023-6237)

    done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more
    large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this
    computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA
    key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL
    pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the
    '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by
    this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. Found by OSS-Fuzz. Fix

  - Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or
    parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
    generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(),
    DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may
    experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an
    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks
    (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable
    for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an
    excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls
    DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source
    could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(),
    EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
    application when using the -pubcheck option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.
    The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
    are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-5678)

  - Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might
    corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides
    vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is
    used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The
    POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the
    contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these
    vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer
    PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal
    application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
    depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker
    could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector
    registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some
    application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm
    is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated
    data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If
    this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.
    This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are
    currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider
    this a Low severity security issue. (CVE-2023-6129)

  - Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a
    potential Denial of Service attack Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from
    untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and
    may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL
    does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in
    OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs
    then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
    PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and
    PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function
    is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and
    3.0 are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-0727)

    It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive
    CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative

referenced in the USN-6666-1 advisory.

  - libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function
    in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to
    256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like
    `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft
    payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due
    to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and
    subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a
    terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar
    to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache
    these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username.
    This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2024-24806)

affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the USN-6721-1 advisory.

  - A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcXIGetSelectedEvents()
    function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to
    memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different
    endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory
    values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a
    crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small
    length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds
    reads. (CVE-2024-31080)

  - A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice()
    function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to

  - The X.Org project reports: The ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function uses the byte-swapped
    length of the return data for the amount of data to return to               the client, if the client has
    a different endianness than               the X server. The ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function uses the

141118,,,None,Server,tcp,22,Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided,Valid credentials were provided for an available authentication protocol.,"Nessus was able to determine that valid credentials were provided for
an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

USN-6429-3 advisory.

  - CVE-2023-38545 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake in libcurl and
    curl.  When curl is given a hostname to pass along to a SOCKS5 proxy that is greater than 255 bytes in
    length, it will switch to local name resolution in order to resolve the address before passing it on to
    the SOCKS5 proxy. However, due to a bug introduced in 2020, this local name resolution could fail due to a
    slow SOCKS5 handshake, causing curl to pass on the hostname greater than 255 bytes in length into the
    target buffer, leading to a heap overflow.  The advisory for CVE-2023-38545 gives an example exploitation
    scenario of a malicious HTTPS server redirecting to a specially crafted URL. While it might seem that an
    attacker would need to influence the slowness of the SOCKS5 handshake, the advisory states that server
    latency is likely slow enough to trigger this bug. (CVE-2023-38545)

  - CVE-2023-38546 is a cookie injection vulnerability in the curl_easy_duphandle(), a function in libcurl
    that duplicates easy handles.  When duplicating an easy handle, if cookies are enabled, the duplicated
    easy handle will not duplicate the cookies themselves, but would instead set the filename to none.'
    Therefore, when the duplicated easy handle is subsequently used, if a source was not set for the cookies,
    libcurl would attempt to load them from the file named none' on the disk.  This vulnerability is rated
    low, as the various conditions required for exploitation are unlikely.  (CVE-2023-38546)

  - The vulnerability exists due to an error in the way SMB protocol implementation in Samba handles file
    operations. A remote user can request read-only access to files and then truncate them to 0 bytes by

  - libcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are
    vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by
    downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then
    automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use
    libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue

  - Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated
    data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV
    algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing adding
    or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently
    unaware of any such applications. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
    data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call
    EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input
    buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of
    performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As
    this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an
    application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue. (CVE-2023-2975)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
    or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been
    obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too
    large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is
    over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
    parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has
    already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters
    obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those
    other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
    EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
    when using the '-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The

  - The X.Org project reports: When prepending values to an existing property an             invalid offset
    calculation causes the existing values to             be appended at the wrong offset. The resulting
    memcpy()             would write into memory outside the heap-allocated             array. This
    vulnerability requires a legacy multi-screen setup             with multiple protocol screens (Zaphod).
    If the pointer             is warped from one screen to the root window of the other             screen,
    the enter/leave code may retain a reference to the             previous pointer window. Destroying this
    window leaves             that reference in place, other windows may then trigger a             use-after-
    free bug when they are destroyed.  (CVE-2023-5367, CVE-2023-5380)

  - urllib3 before 1.24.2 does not remove the authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect
    (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the
    authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. NOTE: this issue
    exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-20060 (which was case-sensitive). (CVE-2018-25091)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header
    special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been
    patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP
    request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method
    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle
    301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input length validation in `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read
    out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all
    users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the drive redirection channel -
    command line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`. (CVE-2022-41877)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.
    Affected versions are subject to an invalid offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Write. This can be
    triggered when the values `rect->left` and `rect->top` are exactly equal to `surface->width` and
    `surface->height`. eg. `rect->left` == `surface->width` && `rect->top` == `surface->height`. In practice
    this should cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-39352)

  - FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license.
    In affected versions a missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound Read in the function

    `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles
    without proper boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead to a crash.

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1897, CVE-2022-2000)

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - Uncontrolled Recursion in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4975. (CVE-2022-1771)

  - Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1886)

  - Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1897, CVE-2022-2000)

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

  - NULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4959. (CVE-2022-1725)

  - Uncontrolled Recursion in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4975. (CVE-2022-1771)

  - Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1886)

  - Out-of-bounds Write in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-1897, CVE-2022-2000)

  - Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2. (CVE-2022-2042)

  - Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the
    function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file
    `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line
    759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted
    value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been
    patched in version 9.0.2068. (CVE-2023-46246)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When closing a window, vim may try to access already freed
    window structure. Exploitation beyond crashing the application has not been shown to be viable. This issue
    has been addressed in commit `25aabc2b` which has been included in release version 9.0.2106. Users are
    advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48231)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the
    line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag.
    This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical
    line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-
    default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to
    upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48232)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. If the count after the :s command is larger than what fits
    into a (signed) long variable, abort with e_value_too_large. Impact is low, user interaction is required
    and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `ac6378773`
    which has been included in release version 9.0.2108. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48233)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When getting the count for a normal mode z command, it may
    overflow for large counts given. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `58f9befca1` which has been included in
    release version 9.0.2109. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48234)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally
    cause an overflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes
    negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a
    crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has
    been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48235)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. When using the z= command, the user may overflow the count
    with values larger than MAX_INT. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even
    happen in all situations. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `73b2d379` which has been
    included in release version 9.0.2111. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
    this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48236)

  - Vim is an open source command line text editor. In affected versions when shifting lines in operator
    pending mode and using a very large value, it may be possible to overflow the size of integer. Impact is
    low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been
    addressed in commit `6bf131888` which has been included in version 9.0.2112. Users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-48237)

  - Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When
    executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
    substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later
    then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
    whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It
    may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue. (CVE-2023-48706)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

  - sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows
    privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for
    AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group
    memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.
    (CVE-2021-41617)

  - In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints can be incompletely applied. When
    destination constraints are specified during addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints
    are only applied to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple keys. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell

  - Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or
    parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
    generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(),
    DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may
    experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an
    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks
    (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable
    for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an
    excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls
    DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source
    could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(),
    EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
    application when using the -pubcheck option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.
    The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
    are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-5678)

  - Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might
    corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides
    vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is
    used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The
    POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the
    contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these
    vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer
    PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal
    application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
    depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker
    could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector
    registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some
    application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm
    is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated
    data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If
    this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.
    This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are
    currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider
    this a Low severity security issue. (CVE-2023-6129)

  - Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a
    potential Denial of Service attack Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from
    untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and
    may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL
    does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in
    OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs
    then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
    PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and
    PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function
    is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and
    3.0 are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-0727)

  - Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time. Impact summary:
    Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long
    delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a
    Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is
    done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more
    large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this
    computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA
    key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL
    pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the
    '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by
    this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. Found by OSS-Fuzz. Fix
    developed by Tomas Mraz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.13 (Affected since 3.0.0). (CVE-2023-6237)

    Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long
    delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a
    Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is
    done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more
    large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this
    computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA
    key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL
    pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the
    '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by
    this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. Found by OSS-Fuzz. Fix
    developed by Tomas Mraz. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.13 (Affected since 3.0.0). (CVE-2023-6237)

  - Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or
    parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
    generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(),
    DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may
    experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an
    untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks
    (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable
    for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an
    excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls
    DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source
    could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also
    called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may
    similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(),
    EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
    application when using the -pubcheck option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.
    The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
    are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2023-5678)

  - Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might
    corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides
    vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is
    used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The
    POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the
    contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these
    vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer
    PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal
    application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
    depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker
    could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector
    registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some
    application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm
    is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated
    data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If
    this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.
    This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are
    currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider
    this a Low severity security issue. (CVE-2023-6129)

  - Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a
    potential Denial of Service attack Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from
    untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and
    may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL
    does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in
    OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs
    then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are:
    PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and
    PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function
    is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and
    3.0 are not affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-0727)

referenced in the USN-6666-1 advisory.

  - libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function
    in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to
    256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like
    `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft
    payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due
    to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and
    subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a
    terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar
    to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache
    these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username.
    This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
    workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2024-24806)

  - c-ares is a C library for asynchronous DNS requests. `ares__read_line()` is used to parse local
    configuration files such as `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, the `HOSTALIASES` file, and if using
    a c-ares version prior to 1.27.0, the `/etc/hosts` file. If any of these configuration files has an
    embedded `NULL` character as the first character in a new line, it can lead to attempting to read memory
    prior to the start of the given buffer which may result in a crash. This issue is fixed in c-ares 1.27.0.
    No known workarounds exist. (CVE-2024-25629)

  - The X.Org project reports: The ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function uses the byte-swapped
    length of the return data for the amount of data to return to               the client, if the client has
    a different endianness than               the X server. The ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function uses the
    byte-swapped             length of the return data for the amount of data to return to             the
    client, if the client has a different endianness than             the X server. The ProcRenderAddGlyphs()
    function calls the AllocateGlyph()             function to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X
    server.             AllocateGlyph() would return a new glyph with refcount=0 and             a re-used
    glyph would end up not changing the refcount at all.             The resulting glyph_new array would thus
    have multiple entries             pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs.
    ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, resulting in a             use-after-free when the same glyph
    pointer is then later used. (CVE-2024-31083)

    endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory
    values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a
    crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small
    length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds

  - The X.Org project reports: The ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function uses the byte-swapped
    length of the return data for the amount of data to return to               the client, if the client has
    a different endianness than               the X server. The ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function uses the

    function calls the AllocateGlyph()             function to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X
    server.             AllocateGlyph() would return a new glyph with refcount=0 and             a re-used
    glyph would end up not changing the refcount at all.             The resulting glyph_new array would thus
    have multiple entries             pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs.
    ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, resulting in a             use-after-free when the same glyph
    pointer is then later used. (CVE-2024-31083)

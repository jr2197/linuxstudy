attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which
may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based
authentication protocols.

Timestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 /
2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of
the actual system time.","Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP
timestamp replies (14).",,"The remote clock is synchronized with the local clock.

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that

  - This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When curl is asked to
    pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting
    done by curl itself, the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes. If the host name is detected
    to be longer, curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due
    to this bug, the local variable that means let the host resolve the name could get the wrong value
    during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long host name to the target
    buffer instead of copying just the resolved address there. The target buffer being a heap based buffer,

  - A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to
    Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients
    to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand.
    However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe
    name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as
    root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe
    name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to
    unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service
    crashes. (CVE-2023-3961)

  - A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with
    read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module acl_xattr is configured with acl_xattr:ignore system
    acls = yes. The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then
    implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create
    disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks,
    relying solely on Samba's permissions. (CVE-2023-4091)

  - A vulnerability was found in Samba's rpcecho development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test
    Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked
    indefinitely. The issue arises because the rpcecho service operates with only one worker in the main RPC
    task, allowing calls to the rpcecho server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service
    disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a sleep() call in the dcesrv_echo_TestSleep() function
    under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls
    to the rpcecho server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most
    services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as
    rpcecho runs in the main RPC task. (CVE-2023-42669)

  - On some systemsdepending on the graphics settings and driversit was possible to force an out-of-bounds
    read and leak memory data into the images created on the canvas element. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6204)

  - It was possible to cause the use of a MessagePort after it had already been freed, which could potentially
    have led to an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and
    Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6205)

  - The black fade animation when exiting fullscreen is roughly the length of the anti-clickjacking delay on
    permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring them to click where the
    permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR <
    115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6206)

    < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6207)

  - When using X11, text selected by the page using the Selection API was erroneously copied into the primary
    selection, a temporary storage not unlike the clipboard. *This bug only affects Firefox on X11. Other
    systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird
    < 115.5. (CVE-2023-6208)

  - Relative URLs starting with three slashes were incorrectly parsed, and a path-traversal /../ part in the
    path could be used to override the specified host. This could contribute to security problems in web
    sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 120, Firefox ESR < 115.5.0, and Thunderbird < 115.5.

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the

    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6865)

  - The timing of a button click causing a popup to disappear was approximately the same length as the anti-
    clickjacking delay on permission prompts. It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring
    them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 115.6 and Firefox < 121. (CVE-2023-6867)

the RHSA-2024:0310 advisory.

  - Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths.
    This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.
    Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could result in loss of
    confidentiality for some cipher modes. When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
    EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been
    established. Any alterations to the key length, via the keylen parameter or the IV length, via the
    ivlen parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing
    truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4,
    RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of
    confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a
    deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both
    truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in
    some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
    critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable
    API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers will have spotted this
    problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
    vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to this to be
    quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For these
    reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is
    not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because the
    issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

  - An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUB uses the UUID of a device to
    search for the configuration file that contains the password hash for the GRUB password protection
    feature. An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stick containing a file system
    with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the /boot/ file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection
    feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. This issue was
    introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header
    special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been
    patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP
    request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method
    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle
    301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and
    mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of
    ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and
    (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API

  - This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set super cookies in curl that are then passed back to more

    sent to different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in
    curl's function that verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For example a
    cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though

referenced in the RHSA-2024:1485 advisory.

  - NSS was susceptible to a timing side-channel attack when performing RSA decryption. This attack could
    potentially allow an attacker to recover the private data. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124,
    Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2023-5388)

  - An unchecked return value in TLS handshake code could have caused a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-0743)

  - Return registers were overwritten which could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code. *Note:*
    This issue only affected Armv7-A systems. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2607)

  - `AppendEncodedAttributeValue(), ExtraSpaceNeededForAttrEncoding()` and `AppendEncodedCharacters()` could
    have experienced integer overflows, causing underallocation of an output buffer leading to an out of
    bounds write. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9.
    (CVE-2024-2608)

  - Using a markup injection an attacker could have stolen nonce values. This could have been used to bypass
    strict content security policies. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and
    Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2610)

  - A missing delay on when pointer lock was used could have allowed a malicious page to trick a user into
    granting permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird <
    115.9. (CVE-2024-2611)

  - If an attacker could find a way to trigger a particular code path in `SafeRefPtr`, it could have triggered
    a crash or potentially be leveraged to achieve code execution. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124,
    Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2612)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 123, Firefox ESR 115.8, and Thunderbird 115.8. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and
    Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2614)

  - To harden ICU against exploitation, the behavior for out-of-memory conditions was changed to crash instead
    of attempt to continue. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 115.9 and Thunderbird < 115.9.

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

  - This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When curl is asked to
    pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting
    done by curl itself, the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes. If the host name is detected
    to be longer, curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due
    to this bug, the local variable that means let the host resolve the name could get the wrong value

  - A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to
    Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients
    to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand.
    However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe
    name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as
    root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe
    name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to
    unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service
    crashes. (CVE-2023-3961)

  - A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with
    read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module acl_xattr is configured with acl_xattr:ignore system
    acls = yes. The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then
    implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create
    disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks,
    relying solely on Samba's permissions. (CVE-2023-4091)

  - A vulnerability was found in Samba's rpcecho development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test
    Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked
    indefinitely. The issue arises because the rpcecho service operates with only one worker in the main RPC
    task, allowing calls to the rpcecho server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service
    disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a sleep() call in the dcesrv_echo_TestSleep() function
    under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls
    to the rpcecho server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most
    services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as

referenced in the RHSA-2023:6744 advisory.

  - A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to
    Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients
    to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand.
    However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe
    name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as
    root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe
    name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to
    unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service
    crashes. (CVE-2023-3961)

  - A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with
    read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module acl_xattr is configured with acl_xattr:ignore system
    acls = yes. The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then
    implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create
    disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks,
    relying solely on Samba's permissions. (CVE-2023-4091)

  - A vulnerability was found in Samba's rpcecho development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test
    Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked
    indefinitely. The issue arises because the rpcecho service operates with only one worker in the main RPC
    task, allowing calls to the rpcecho server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service
    disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a sleep() call in the dcesrv_echo_TestSleep() function
    under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls
    to the rpcecho server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most
    services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as
    rpcecho runs in the main RPC task. (CVE-2023-42669)

187201,CVE-2023-48795,6.4,Medium,Desktop,tcp,22,OpenSSH < 9.6 Multiple Vulnerabilities,The SSH server running on the remote host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.,"The version of OpenSSH installed on the remote host is prior to 9.6. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.

  - Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths.
    This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.
    Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could result in loss of
    confidentiality for some cipher modes. When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
    EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been
    established. Any alterations to the key length, via the keylen parameter or the IV length, via the
    ivlen parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing
    truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4,
    RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of
    confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a
    deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both
    truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in
    some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
    critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable
    API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers will have spotted this
    problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
    vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to this to be
    quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For these
    reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is
    not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because the
    issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header
    special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been
    patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP
    request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method
    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle

    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1548)

  - If a website set a large custom cursor, portions of the cursor could have overlapped with the permission
    dialog, potentially resulting in user confusion and unexpected granted permissions. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1549)

  - A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and `requestPointerLock` to
    cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and
    inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1550)

  - Set-Cookie response headers were being incorrectly honored in multipart HTTP responses. If an attacker
    could control the Content-Type response header, as well as control part of the response body, they could
    inject Set-Cookie response headers that would have been honored by the browser. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1551)

  - Incorrect code generation could have led to unexpected numeric conversions and potential undefined
    behavior.*Note:* This issue only affects 32-bit ARM devices. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1552)

    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and

  - The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other
    products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
    extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for
    which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because
    the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and

referenced in the RHSA-2024:1485 advisory.

  - NSS was susceptible to a timing side-channel attack when performing RSA decryption. This attack could
    potentially allow an attacker to recover the private data. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124,
    Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2023-5388)

  - An unchecked return value in TLS handshake code could have caused a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 122, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-0743)

  - Return registers were overwritten which could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code. *Note:*
    This issue only affected Armv7-A systems. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2607)

  - `AppendEncodedAttributeValue(), ExtraSpaceNeededForAttrEncoding()` and `AppendEncodedCharacters()` could
    have experienced integer overflows, causing underallocation of an output buffer leading to an out of
    bounds write. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9.
    (CVE-2024-2608)

  - Using a markup injection an attacker could have stolen nonce values. This could have been used to bypass
    strict content security policies. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and
    Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2610)

  - A missing delay on when pointer lock was used could have allowed a malicious page to trick a user into
    granting permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird <
    115.9. (CVE-2024-2611)

  - If an attacker could find a way to trigger a particular code path in `SafeRefPtr`, it could have triggered
    a crash or potentially be leveraged to achieve code execution. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124,
    Firefox ESR < 115.9, and Thunderbird < 115.9. (CVE-2024-2612)

  - Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 123, Firefox ESR 115.8, and Thunderbird 115.8. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 124, Firefox ESR < 115.9, and

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux

  - This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy handshake. When curl is asked to
    pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it getting
    done by curl itself, the maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes. If the host name is detected
    to be longer, curl switches to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due
    to this bug, the local variable that means let the host resolve the name could get the wrong value
    during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long host name to the target
    buffer instead of copying just the resolved address there. The target buffer being a heap based buffer,
    and the host name coming from the URL that curl has been told to operate with. (CVE-2023-38545)

  - This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running program using libcurl, if the
    specific series of conditions are met. libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates
    easy handles that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurl provides a function call that
    duplicates en easy handle called
    [curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html). If a transfer has cookies
    enabled when the handle is duplicated, the cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the
    actual cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on disk, the cloned
    version of the handle would instead store the file name as `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no
    quotes). Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from
    would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named `none` - if such a file exists and is readable in
    the current directory of the program using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.

  - This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running program using libcurl, if the
    specific series of conditions are met. libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates
    easy handles that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurl provides a function call that
    duplicates en easy handle called
    [curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html). If a transfer has cookies
    enabled when the handle is duplicated, the cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the
    actual cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on disk, the cloned
    version of the handle would instead store the file name as `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no
    quotes). Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to load cookies from
    would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named `none` - if such a file exists and is readable in
    the current directory of the program using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.

  - A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to
    Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients
    to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand.
    However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe
    name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as
    root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe
    name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to
    unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service
    crashes. (CVE-2023-3961)

  - A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with
    read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module acl_xattr is configured with acl_xattr:ignore system
    acls = yes. The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then
    implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create
    disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks,
    relying solely on Samba's permissions. (CVE-2023-4091)

  - A vulnerability was found in Samba's rpcecho development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test
    Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked
    indefinitely. The issue arises because the rpcecho service operates with only one worker in the main RPC
    task, allowing calls to the rpcecho server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service
    disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a sleep() call in the dcesrv_echo_TestSleep() function
    under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls
    to the rpcecho server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most
    services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as
    rpcecho runs in the main RPC task. (CVE-2023-42669)

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

the RHSA-2024:0310 advisory.

  - Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths.
    This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.
    Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could result in loss of
    confidentiality for some cipher modes. When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or
    EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been
    established. Any alterations to the key length, via the keylen parameter or the IV length, via the
    ivlen parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing
    truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4,
    RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of
    confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a
    deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both
    truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in
    some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
    critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable
    API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers will have spotted this
    problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
    vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to this to be
    quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For these
    reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is
    not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because the
    issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header
    special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user.
    However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been
    patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5. (CVE-2023-43804)

  - urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP
    request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method
    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle
    301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)

    changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs.
    Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
    together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client
    implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
    service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability
    of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request
    bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions
    must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information
    in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts
    redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.
    This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve
    this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond
    with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle
    301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body. (CVE-2023-45803)

  - When storing and re-accessing data on a networking channel, the length of buffers may have been confused,
    resulting in an out-of-bounds memory read. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8,
    and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1546)

  - Through a series of API calls and redirects, an attacker-controlled alert dialog could have been displayed
    on another website (with the victim website's URL shown). This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1547)

  - A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a dropdown select input element. This
    could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,
    Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1548)

  - If a website set a large custom cursor, portions of the cursor could have overlapped with the permission

    affects Firefox < 123, Firefox ESR < 115.8, and Thunderbird < 115.8. (CVE-2024-1549)

  - A malicious website could have used a combination of exiting fullscreen mode and `requestPointerLock` to
    cause the user's mouse to be re-positioned unexpectedly, which could have led to user confusion and
    inadvertently granting permissions they did not intend to grant. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123,

    attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the
    KeyTrap issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the
    protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG
    records. (CVE-2023-50387)

  - The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped)
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC
    responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the NSEC3 issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an

  - Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the
    KeyTrap issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the
    protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG
    records. (CVE-2023-50387)

  - The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped)
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC
    responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the NSEC3 issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an
    algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations. (CVE-2023-50868)

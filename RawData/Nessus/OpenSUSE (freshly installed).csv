attacker to know the date that is set on the targeted machine, which
may assist an unauthenticated, remote attacker in defeating time-based
authentication protocols.

Timestamps returned from machines running Windows Vista / 7 / 2008 /
2008 R2 are deliberately incorrect, but usually within 1000 seconds of
the actual system time.","Filter out the ICMP timestamp requests (13), and the outgoing ICMP
timestamp replies (14).",,"The difference between the local and remote clocks is -4 seconds.

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

credentials. The provided credentials have the highest privilege
possible on the remote host.  Yet Nessus encountered permissions
issues while accessing items during the scan.

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a
    permissions error.

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

credentials. The provided credentials have the highest privilege
possible on the remote host.  Yet Nessus encountered permissions
issues while accessing items during the scan.

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a
    permissions error.

If you believe that the plugin indicated attempted to access the
wrong resource or a resource that has recently received special OS

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"

credentials. The provided credentials have the highest privilege
possible on the remote host.  Yet Nessus encountered permissions
issues while accessing items during the scan.

It is likely that this condition is caused by one or more of the
following:

1)  A plugin tried to access a resource that requires a special
    privilege level such as NT_AUTHORITY on Windows.  The resource
    may have had its permissions altered since the plugin was
    written.
2)  Environmental issues may have caused an intermittent failure
    in authentication that caused Nessus to stop attempting
    privilege escalation.
3)  A resource on the host that Nessus attempts to access multiple
    times may be configured with access limits.  Related lockouts may
    look like permissions failures.
4)  Nessus may have tried to access a resource that does not exist
    on a target that fails to properly report permissions issues.
    For instance, on some legacy unix systems such as AIX or HP-UX
    there is no way to distinguish a missing resource from a
    permissions error.

If you believe that the plugin indicated attempted to access the
wrong resource or a resource that has recently received special OS

vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.

  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by
    Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of
    the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the
    commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after
    encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While
    cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows
    deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user
    user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact
    is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing
    the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.
    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this
    protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
    both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to
    improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the
    connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages
    that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability
    from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of
    each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to
    the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to
    thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source
    distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)

  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the
    PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular
    private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)

  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a
    ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h
    or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could
    potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied
    ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository
    could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell
    metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we
    believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially
    across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters
    from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
    effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters
    potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject
    to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the
    assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files. (CVE-2023-51385)

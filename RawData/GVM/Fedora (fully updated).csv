Notes on the ""Linux Kernel status (SSH response)"" column:
- sysfs file missing: The sysfs interface is available but the sysfs file for this specific vulnerability is missing. This means the current Linux Kernel doesn't know this vulnerability yet. Based on this it is assumed that it doesn't provide any mitigation and that the target system is vulnerable.
- Strings including ""Mitigation:"", ""Not affected"" or ""Vulnerable"" are reported directly by the Linux Kernel.
- All other strings are responses to various SSH commands.

Notes on the ""Linux Kernel status (SSH response)"" column:
- sysfs file missing: The sysfs interface is available but the sysfs file for this specific vulnerability is missing. This means the current Linux Kernel doesn't know this vulnerability yet. Based on this it is assumed that it doesn't provide any mitigation and that the target system is vulnerable.
- Strings including ""Mitigation:"", ""Not affected"" or ""Vulnerable"" are reported directly by the Linux Kernel.
- All other strings are responses to various SSH commands.

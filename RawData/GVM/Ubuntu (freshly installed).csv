Original advisory details:

 Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled
 memory when processing the DeviceFocusEvent and ProcXIQueryPointer APIs. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the X Server to crash,
 obtain sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6816)

 Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled
 reattaching to a different master device. An attacker could use this issue
 to cause the X Server to crash, leading to a denial of service, or possibly
 execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-0229)

 Olivier Fourdan and Donn Seeley discovered that the X.Org X Server
 incorrectly labeled GLX PBuffers when used with SELinux. An attacker could
 use this issue to cause the X Server to crash, leading to a denial of
 service. (CVE-2024-0408)

 Olivier Fourdan discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled
 the curser code when used with SELinux. An attacker could use this issue to
 cause the X Server to crash, leading to a denial of service.
 (CVE-2024-0409)

 Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled
 memory when processing the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent API. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to cause the X Server to crash, or execute
 arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-21885)

 Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled
 devices being disabled. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause
 the X Server to crash, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-21886)","Checks if a vulnerable package version is present on the target host.

Window System. ImageMagick can read and write JPEG, TIFF, PNM, GIF,
and Photo CD image formats. It can resize, rotate, sharpen, color
reduce, or add special effects to an image, and when finished you can
either save the completed work in the original format or a different
one. ImageMagick also includes command line programs for creating
animated or transparent .gifs, creating composite images, creating
thumbnail images, and more.

ImageMagick is one of your choices if you need a program to manipulate
and display images. If you want to develop your own applications
which use ImageMagick code or APIs, you need to install
ImageMagick-devel as well.","Checks if a vulnerable package version is present on the target host.

podman uses Buildah(1) internally to create container images.
